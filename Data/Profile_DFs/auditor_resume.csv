HOMAS COMM: 253-962-1215\nCOL THOMAS S. BUNDT COMM: 253-968-1210\n\nServes as Chief, Internal Review and Audit Compliance for the Department of Defense\'s premier Healthcare System ($500M annual budget) comprised of a 1.3 million square foot, 243-bed tertiary care teaching medical center and level-II trauma center, nearly 180 in-house medical clinics, three free-standing health clinics, an outpatient medical annex, and a Soldier Readiness Processing site serving I Corps, the Joint Base Lewis McChord power projection platform, the Presidio of Monterey, and the surrounding communities with high quality primary and specialty care to over 112,000 TRICARE beneficiaries with a staff of about 5,500 Soldiers, civilians, volunteers, and contractors.\n\nThis position was gapped for two years. During this period, I completed five audits on time and attendance (payroll overtime), Title 38 on-call pay, dining facility subsistence food inventory and non-consumable supplies, telework program, and off duty employment program. For each engagement, I developed the audit program, defined scope and methodology, outlined and performed audits tests and analyses, comparative analyses and reconciliations, conducted field work and interviewed managers, supervisors , and employees, prepared working papers, prepared and presented in-process reviews, communicated the results, generated draft report products, presented findings to auditees and consensus among stakeholders on recommendations, and completed the final report package. Prepared briefing charts and brief the commander and staff on my findings and recommendations. Tracked and monitored the implementation of corrective action, conducted training to Army interns and officers, supervisors, and employees result of reviews (findings and recommendations). My efforts on these five audits resulted in recommendations that enhanced mission readiness, improved processes and management controls, restructured operations and automated systems that resulted in potential monetary benefits (PMB) of $5.7 million.\n\nAs the commander\'s principal advisor on internal control and internal audit activities, advised and assisted the commander regarding audit activity being conducted by United States Army Audit Agency, Government Accountability Office, Department of Defense Inspector General, and other external oversight organizations. I successfully coordinated the liaison and logistics support of external agencies audit visits to MAMC. Directed, managed, and executed a full range of internal review services prescribed in the department of the Army regulation and consistent with the needs of the organization. Establish and maintain a risk assessment management program in accordance with Department of the Army Regulation. I advised the Commander on accounting, financial, and managerial issues that required thorough examination by a financial professional.\n\nPerform quick response reviews, consulting and advisory services, risk management, liaison with external audit organizations, audit compliance and follow-up, and a variety of staff and systems accounting duties to analyze accounting records to enhance the financial reports and operational data used by management. I performed the most complex analysis and evaluations by conducting a variety of reviews that are usually without precedent. As the Chief, IR, I took care of the most complex financial and operational issues, assigned and monitored audit work performed by audit staff and provided guidance to staff auditors; ensured audit work by audit staff to meet GAGAS standards; mentored and trained audit staff and ensured they developed professional proficiency.\n\nHere are the highlights of my audits:\n\u27a2 On the civilian pay overtime audit, I reviewed time and attendance process and procedures to identify the root causes of excessive overtime that amounted to $3.5 million for FY11. I identified the root causes for excessive overtime, prepared complete draft report packages, obtained consensus among stakeholders on five recommendations in order to curb overtime. Coordinated and facilitated command-wide successful training completion of 172 certificates for Certifying Official Legislation (COL) course and Civilian Pay Course for time keepers, certifying officials, and departmental accountable officers. My efforts accomplished follow-up reviews of five recommendations that identified $1.5 million in potential overtime cost savings.\n\u27a2 On the review of active duty service members (ADSM) stationed in Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the Federal government spent $5.3 million for ADSM referred to privately-owned behavioral health hospitals for the treatment of PTSD, Comb drug dep NEC-contin, Alcohol dep NEC/NOS-contin, Opioid/other dep-contin, depress psychosis, amphetamine dependency, and other behavioral health-related issues. The review included diagnostic trend analysis, pattern of referrals, pharmacy costs, medical treatment costs, bed days spent, cost per patient per day, and the aggregate cost per year. Draft report were presented to stakeholders mostly ASAP and behavioral health providers, IMD and Informatics supervisors. Consensus from the stakeholders were obtained on recommendations to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of providing intensive treatment at Madigan and to partner with Balboa Navy Hospital and Tripler Army Medical Center to take care of ADMS with behavioral issues. This program could take care at least 70% of the ADSM now being referred for inpatient care at a fraction of the cost and could provide a ""step down"" program for those ADSM requiring inpatient care as they transition back to full duty. The successful implementation of these recommendations could generate a potential referral cost savings of $3.71 million.']","[u'CAPs in compliance', u'MBA in Human Capital Management', u'in Personal Finance', u'in Introduction to Finance and Accounting', u'', u'in Principles of Accounting I']","[u'COL JOHN W.
