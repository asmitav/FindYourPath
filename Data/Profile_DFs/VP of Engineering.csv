Led innovation and commitment to meeting exacting standards for this\nmanufacturer of high performance engineered polymers and thermoplastic solutions, including rotationally moldable\nresins for demanding applications in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries. Negotiated prices and service agreements with key suppliers. Headed team of 16.\nManaged portfolio of 12 accounts representing $4.5M in sales. Evaluated market trends and allocated marketing\nbudget. Designed sales forecasting and segment strategies. Qualified prospects and sales opportunities in targeted\nmarkets. Quoted prices, credit terms and other bid specifications. Led cross-functional teams in creating impactful\nmessaging, demand-generation programs and sales tools. Formulated custom business plans for incoming account\nmanagers.\n\u2022 Drove growth without increasing costs, ultimately securing major client. The capital investment firm\nthat had acquired RMB had set a very aggressive five-year growth goal. While driving growth is a difficult\ntask by itself, the job was made more challenging by the requirement that further capital expenditures and new hires would be unavailable until new sales were generated. In order to promote sales growth without\nincreasing headcount, negotiated advantageous commission rates with and developed a new US-based\nrepresentative and distribution network with existing experience with and sales to semiconductor OEMs,\nRMB\'s target market. Contracted with additional representatives in Europe, South Korea and Israel. Within\nsix months, the domestic market representatives were generating a total of over $1M in annualized sales,\nincluding a relationship with LAM Research that within three years became the division\'s #1 client with yearly revenues of over $3M. Led cross-functional sales, engineering, quality and manufacturing teams in\npositioning RMB as LAM\'s preferred supplier in only \u2154 the time usually required. As preferred supplier,\nachieved and maintained an 8.32 score in a supplier pool in which 80% of LAM\'s vendors earned an average score of 17. Secured LAM\'s ""World Class"" supplier designation.\n\u2022 Created lucrative new market for advanced technology. Led RMB teams in development of a new\nrotomolded container using a new machine. Although interested, numerous companies did not want to\n""risk"" being the first to use new cryogenic storage container technology. Identified technology ""champions"" in the industry; officials in the manufacturing R&D division of major biopharmaceutical company\nMerck individuals senior enough to drive allocation of resources and funds, and hungry enough to pursue\nthis market disruptor for the next two-to-three years. Because this was a new technology for manufacturing a new component with direct contact with injectable pharmaceutical solutions, needed to satisfy both\nMerck\'s internal quality auditors, scientists and supplier management teams; and the uncompromising\nreviewers at the FDA. Secured $2.5M from Merck for development of the new technology and its\nassociated testing systems, satisfying the RMB board\'s aversion to allocating capital funds. Participated as a principal in filing a joint patent. Negotiated Merck\'s licensing of RMB in perpetuity to manufacture and sell the new container technology with a minimal (1% of the sell price) royalty per container.\n\u2022 Created marketing collaboration driving new product introduction. Refocused from successful\ntechnology development to marketing new product. Sought a go-to-market partner already established in the industry, ready to compete with current disposable storage solutions, offering a current product to\nmanufacture off-the-shelf and custom silicon top works. Identified Meissner Filtration as the partner\nmotivated to ""take the ball and run."" Meissner quickly proved themselves to be focused, diligent and responsive, committing funds and resources to completing the validation binder for this solution set to\nlaunch at Interphex 2018, the country\'s premier pharmaceutical, biotechnology and device development,\nmanufacturing and commercialization event.\n\u2022 Negotiated key supply chain provisions that protected vital client relationship. After securing\ncontracts with LAM Research for the supply of custom-molded Teflon tanks, needed to ensure an adequate\nsupply of PFA from a customer-imposed exclusive supplier. Historically, this material has cyclical supply\nissues, due to manufacturing and market issues. Based on customer\'s forecast demand, successfully\nnegotiated with Daikin and GSI representatives to spread the risk. Agreed that each company would keep a\nminimum amount of material in stock at all times, and executed a long-term agreement with both companies. Quickly benefitted from this foresight and preparation as Daikin found itself unable to\nmanufacture powdered PFA resin when the company was severely disrupted by the 2011 tsunami affecting\nJapan\'s northern coast. However, due to the stock carried by all three companies by prior agreement,\nRMB\'s ability to supply molded tanks to LAM Research was unaffected.\n\u2022 Further cemented relationship with valued customer by enabling them to meet their own customer\ndelivery obligations when other suppliers had failed them. RMB\'s client LAM Research faced a\nshortage of compression molded PVDF provided by other suppliers, threatening to delay shipments of their\ndeposition tools. RMB did not stock PVDF in the needed grade, but did use several grades of Nylon in the laser-sintering department. Determined that RMB could sinter its six-month supply of rotomold grade\nfluoropolymer available in inventory. Working with R&D team, made usable samples available within two\nweeks. The demand for these parts is estimated to exceed $7M annualized for 2018.', u""Program Manager\nRMB Products Inc\nJanuary 2008 to January 2011\nLed engineering and manufacturing teams producing\nplastic components for the semiconductor industry. Created better forecasting tools that prevented over and under inventory conditions during extreme cyclical swings in semiconductor industry. Developed new products for and\nopened new markets in industries with stringent cleanliness requirements. Collaborated with sales team.\n\u2022 Identified and pursued new market, rebuilding shrinking revenue. Worked closely with sales in actively\naddressing the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry's negative effect in revenue. 9/11 worsened the decline even further, resulting in an approximately 65% loss of revenue year-over-year. Took the initiative to identify and open new revenue streams. Performed high-kevel market investigation into\nindustries that have strict production facility cleanliness requirements, much like the semiconductor\nindustry. Focused the company on biopharmaceuticals and food pasteurization. Contacted the Director of\nEngineering for Avure Technologies, resulting in an agreement to manufacture a basket used in their high\npressure food processing (HPP) equipment. Avure propagated the new basket design across their entire\nproduct offering, resulting in over $500K in yearly sales. Also worked with the Director for New\nTechnologies at Glaxo-Smith-Kline, leading to business agreement to develop a new container to be used in cryogenic storage and transport of biologic compounds. Introduction of a disposable rigid container with the advantages of a bag but with lower capital equipment costs continues to be a market disruptor. GSK\nbecame an important customer for RMB with over $1M in yearly sales. Earned recognition as co-inventor as GSK and RMB jointly filed for patent protection. This product line became the precursor for other\nreusable containers made of Teflon. Another customer (Centocor) was captured with this line, adding yet more revenue to the rejuvenated sales channel."", u""Engineering Product Manager\nRMB Products Inc\nJanuary 1996 to January 2008\nStrengthened manufacturing methodology.\nIncreased revenue and profitability by 35% and 45% respectively.\n\u2022 Retained important customer, facilitating annualized sales jump from $150K to $550K that to grow. Avure Technologies liked the quality of RMB's baskets used in their HPP machines, but they were facing market pressure to cut prices due to availability of a competitor's lower cost version of\nRMB's offering. Avure was considering contracting another molder to make the cheaper version. RMB's\nnylon-based products were technically superior to competitor's HDPE-based product, and did not risk\ndamaging Avure's hydro pressure chambers. But even though RMB's baskets lasted over 20 times longer under normal use, they still could not command a 3X price premium. Quickly addressed the issue of nylon\ncosting 15X the price of competitor's HDPE. Determined that RMB's Aerospace Division generated large\namounts of scrap nylon, many times the volume of RMB Semiconductor and Biopharmaceutical Division's\nproduction needs. Worked with Materials Engineering to compound these nylon remnants into micro pellets\nthat could be used for rotational molding. Reduced materials cost from $20 per pound to $0.48 per pound,\nless than half of the cost of the competitor's HDPE. Quickly reestablished RMB's ability to compete on price with the HDPE baskets, dramatically increasing demand.\n\u2022 Cut costs while optimizing throughput and productivity. Applied technical skills to resolving an ongoing\nproductivity problem. There was a quality issue with the wafer carrier line. The process called for bonding of ETFE bars. The entire surface was to be lined with resin in powder form, but the bars would drift away from the desired position during the lining stage. Throughput was running at an unacceptable 65%. The\nproblem needed to be resolved, but due to high production requirements, all R&D would have to be done without interrupting production. Changed the bonding process, and heating and machining methods.\nEliminated variability problems. Reduced total touch time by 50%. Reduced scrap while increasing\nthroughput from 65% to 98%. Customer was so pleased with this delivery and quality improvement that\nthey never requested a reduction in cost.""]","[u'Bachelor of Science in Production Engineering', u'']","[u'Universidad Aut\xf3noma de Durango', u'Dale Carnegie Skills for Success, Dale Carnegie Training']","degree_1 : Bachelor of Science in Prodction Engineering, degree_2 :  "
