I did consulting and contract development for AquaVeo (a Utah based software hydrology company). (C++, Boost). I consulted with a Chinese company, recommending IaaS and PaaS software for a data center. Most recently, I developed, with a pair-programming partner, a phonetic keyboard extension in Swift for iOS. Each key represents a unique phoneme (or sound) rather than a letter, so the user can sound out a word without having to know how to spell it correctly. In most cases, the user can also skip the vowels. Most words appear after entering just a few phonemes. It is available on the iOS App Store as PhonemeKey.', u'Senior Software Engineer\nGoogle, Inc - Mountain View, CA\nApril 2012 to June 2013\nI worked on the Google Maps server team and developed code that makes backend requests to the Google Web Search (GWS) engine and then extracts responses into tailored protocol buffers to directly serve web and mobile UI clients.

The team had a mandate to use a new corporate graphics system (OGS) that was still being developed, but it was barely at the level of supporting device level graphics. The Fusion team needed a scene graph. I led a team of two people in Oregon and four in China to build a scene graph extension to OGS. The system allowed Fusion developers to add scene nodes that corresponded to data model or UI objects to a scene as elements of an instanced component, with particular attributes on the objects or instances. The scene graph then traversed the instance hierarchy, combining attributes and transforms, to produce occurrence nodes that OGS then rendered. It dealt with selections, updates to the occurrence tree as objects were edited, occurrence specific attributes, etc. The OGS system was heavily multi-threaded. Much of the implementation dealt with supporting that but insulating the clients from it. All of the development was in C++, with significant use of Boost libraries and Intel TBB on the Fusion side.

Apply is a completely customizable credit application processing system that specialized in providing a custom built system ready for production in 60 - 180 days. The client applications were written in Borland Delphi while the server applications were written in C or C++ on a UNIX platform.

Customers with proprietary client applications that were required to send credit application data to our servers used this API. This API was originally written as a DLL for Windows using Microsoft Visual C++. It has since been ported to UNIX AIX, Sun Solaris, and HP UNIX.\n\u2022 I created a Brower based GUI front end to our credit application system using Borland Delphi, utilizing the IntraWeb web libraries.

This company was growing so fast that reached a point where they needed to manage all\nthe processes using software in order to keep that fast growing and improve it. Using the experience I got from my previous company Desoft in Cuba, one of the biggest, I started to\nimplement each of those processes using Scrum. It was hard because everything was a mess,\nthere was not people with all the technical knowledge required to get the requirements per\ndepartment. I had to plan a lot of meetings with the departments heads and different employees in order to get all the requirements to be implemented on each iteration. I was doing every step\nof the software development by myself (I am not a GURU), really a great challenge. In order to\nfinish the different modules in a short period of time, I decided to use the ERP System Odoo, AKA\nOpenerp. This open source software, developed by a Belgium company , uses a framework(Open- object), developed by the same company. This framework was built using the model MVC where\nthey used Jquery, Javascript, XML, Qweb to implement the view layer. They used Python (my\npreferred programming language) on the controller, and on the model, they used PostgreSQL and an ORM created by themselves using Python. And as plus, I was working the first year and a half as IT too, yes I know, it sounds insane. Configuring printers, scanners, computers, networking, I\nbarely had time to develop and improve myself. Hopefully they understood how important the\nsoftware is for a company.\n\nModules developed:\n\nReferral Appointments\n- Module to manage all the referral appointments related to patients. The company does not\nhas all the required specialists. Sometimes the internal doctors need a second opinion from an external specialist. It really was a chaos on those times because, the referral department had to manage the whole process using excel, good software but not intended for these purposes. I\ndesigned and developed, in collaboration with the current department, a module capable of\nmanage the whole process from the beginning to the end. The customer services employees\nwere able to handle the calls in regard of these kind of appointments. Previously they had to call the employees of the Referral Department in order to solve an issue regarding a patient, and since it is very difficult to share information using excel, employees were struggling,\nbecause they had to stop what were they doing in order to give the required information. It\ntook me 2 months to finish this module. After designing and creating the business model, I\nEmail: noel.rivero.pino@gmail.com Skype id: noeljrp Linkedin: Noel's profile\n\nimplemented the module in 2 iterations, and a 3rd iteration to deploy and test. It was a challenge but it was super good to know that this module improved a lot the company\nprocesses In this area, and the employees were able to improve their productivity. I keep\nsupporting this module and adding new stuff everyday.\n\nSocial Services\n- Module to manage all the process related to the new patients. The company follows a process\nwhere the Social Department has to manage different types of appointments regarding to patient's health insurances. In order to a person become a patient, this has to accomplish\ncertain requirements, such as age, years living in the United States, health insurances. This\ndepartment was working just using paper and excel. This module was a success because, the employees were able to gather different types of information, such as, amount of patients dis-\nenrolling, persons nearest to accomplish the requirements, and others. At the beginning I\ndecided to add a feature to this module, in order to manage outgoing calls to be executed in the future, department's employees were able of schedule calls, but we decided to create a\nmodule for customer services later on. The patient follows a process where appointments and calls can be added. At the end of the process, this potential patient is converted as a current\npatient. Everything was designed to only have a patient's database (for patients and potential\npatients), and just change the statuses for each process step. Developing time, 2 months, 3\niterations after design.\n\nOTC Services (Over the Counter Medications)\n- Module to manage the delivery of OTC (Over the Counter medications). The company as I\nexplained in the two previous points, was struggling on this process. Everything was flowing\nthrough paper and the telephone, lot of errors, complaints, etc After receiving the orders with the medications at the different facilities, they had to be sent to the headquarters to be\nprocessed, and in order to know the status of the orders, the facilities had to call the OTC\ndepartment, and then the employees from that department had to be searching on different\nboxes or they had to call the insurance company, super inaccurate. After some meetings with the department heads, department employees and company heads, we decided to create a\nprocess where after receiving an order, the same had to be scanned and uploaded to the patient as a digital order, start the process and complete the required information per status.\nThis was challenging, the process is long, from the point where the order with the desired\nmedications is received to the point where the medications are delivered to the patient. Every\nstep in this process is very important, and different departments participate in this process.\nNow customer services does not have to be calling this department when they receive a call from a patient regarding an issue, because, every employee with the right access rights is\ncapable of access to the desired information regarding that patient. This took me 3 weeks to\ndesign and 2 months to develop, split on 4 iterations, and one week of deployment and testing. I keep supporting, fixing bugs and adding tiny features to this module. We are\nplanning to improve the process , in order to do this we are planning to create a digital sheet,\nand we want to integrate the module with USPS for the orders that has to be delivered at home by daily mail in order to keep track of the medications after leaving the facilities.\n\nCustomer Services\n- As each department on this company, customer service was struggling. The Customer\nServices department on any company that offers services, is one of the most important\ndepartments, i name it, the firewall department. They were managing all the information got from calls just using paper, what a chaos, complaints, informations requested, services\nrequested, messages, everything through paper, the employees had to handle a lot of work. We\ncreated a module where, every type of call can be registered. We created 2 main types of calls,\noutgoing calls and incoming. It was a complete success, now each time the facilities want to Email: noel.rivero.pino@gmail.com Skype id: noeljrp Linkedin: Noel's profile\n\nknow some informations related to calls, they do not has to call customer services, they just\nhas to check the system, because the employees from customer services are now very\nproductive and they detail every bit of information on each call. It took me 2 weeks to design\nand 1 month and a half to develop, two weeks for deployment and testing. I keep giving\nsupport, in order to fix bugs and add new features\n\nHuman resources\n- Customized the HR module from Odoo and adapted to the company process. Actually we are\nplanning to add time-sheets, and create new features to improve this important module.\n\nOptometry services\n- Module to manage all the process of lens delivery.\n\nMedical Coding\n- This module was developed to keep track of all the diagnoses related to a patient.\n\nTask\n- This module was an addition to Customer Services in order to assign tasks to the different\nfacility managers in order to solve the problems, the informations requested and the services\nrequested given by the patient through this call.\n\nUnder development\n- Developing a module to help the personnel from Coding and billing to be more productive.\n\nFuture developments\n- Module to manage costs per patient, costs per facility\n- Install the Odoo module Fleet to manage all the costs of the vehicle fleet.\n- Install Odoo modules Accounting, Warehouse."", u""Software Architect, Python developer\nDesoft S.A - La Habana, CU\nSeptember 2011 to June 2013\nFunction:\n- Developing new technologies on Open-object framework to facilitate the work of the development team in the implementation of the Odoo (AKA OpenERP) software version for the\nCuban economy.\n- Teaching classes and courses about the framework Open-object to programmers and training\nnew employees.\n- Teaching classes and courses about Odoo system's usage to programmers.\n- Integrating and customizing the Odoo modules (Accounting, CRM, HR, Sales and Purchases)\non a Cuban Pharmaceutical Enterprise."", u""Software Architect\nUniversity of Informatics Sciences - La Habana, CU\nJuly 2009 to August 2011\nEmail: noel.rivero.pino@gmail.com Skype id: noeljrp Linkedin: Noel's profile\n\nFunction:\n- Leading the front-end developing team at the Entities Management Center (CEIGE).

Functional Programming in Scala, Deployment using Docker containers, Development on Ubuntu,\nand Scrum as our process framework. I was responsible for setting a new direction in choosing language, tooling,\nframeworks, and programing style. I helped to hire and train more than 30 new software or systems engineers. I was the\nprincipal architect of a new data platform for Athlinks products and partners. Some of my goals for this platform were multi-datacenter, horizontally scalable to web scale on cheap hardware, streaming data unification, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Kappa\narchitecture, multiple databases as streaming input, and multiple databases projections to provide specialized functionality\nsuch as Graph, Search, Document Store, and Data Warehousing. This allowed multiple systems to have their data streamed in\ncontinuously allowing old and new systems to run side by side using the same data. A new API was designed on this platform\nthat allowed streaming data subscriptions, declarative client queries via GraphQL, and partial updates via RDF data. Some of\nthe technologies I used in this system were Kafka, Flink, Redis, Docker, Samza, Cassandra, Stardog, Zookeeper,\nElasticSearch, Logstash, Avro, and GraphQL. This system receives streaming data from MySQL, MS-SQL, Divolte click\nstream, along with external data sources.', u'Software Architect\nDealer Socket, Inc - Draper, UT\nJanuary 2014 to January 2015\nArchitected a new platform for Dealer Socket products to be built on. My\ngoals of this platform were state of the art security, scalability, reliability, and performance, with the ability to run on cheap\ncommodity hardware and tolerate multiple machine failures. This required a new Identity and Access Management service to\nbe used by all current and future products. This service was built to support the OpenID Connect protocol and store its data in\nRedis. For the API surface of this platform I recommended and assisted implementing the OData protocol. This was done in a\nway that allowed exposing a new data model on top of the existing data store. This enabled new applications to share data\nwith existing applications even though they use different models. To service search requests, I implemented ElasticSearch, a\nfull-text, clustered search engine based on Lucene. To ensure that data in ElasticSearch would say fresh, I Implemented SQL\nServer CDC, and Kafka to stream changes from all CRM databases to services that do indexing in near real-time. Kafka also\nserves as an integration point for other services like data warehousing, and analytics, with the ability to service streaming and\nbatch processing. ElasticSearch, Kafka, Zookeeper, and Redis were all setup to run on Linux using Docker containers. This\nsimplifies the deployment process of these new systems with better performance characteristics than virtual machines. I also\nadded globalization support to the current CRM with support for customer specific wording, modification at run time, and\nfallback to other locales.', u'Software Architect\nFixed Income Solutions - Midvale, UT\nJanuary 2012 to January 2014\nBOND STREAM (.Net via C#, F#): Architected and assisted implementing a system that receives near real-time Bonds\nMarket data from multiple sources. Aggregates and analyzes the data then combines with user configuration settings to present and deliver algorithmic trading data to users and external systems in near real-time. I chose SQL Server Stream Insight as the stream processing engine because it lets developers write stream queries using a dialect of LINQ very similar to\nthe one used by Reactive Extensions, which was the stream processing library used by the UI and other portions of the application that lived outside of Stream Insight. SQL Server was used to persist runtime configurations and latest state across all bonds. Data sources were isolated from the streaming engine in external processes that wrote messages to MSMQ. This\nalso allowed data sources to be run on separate servers. Communication with clients was done with WCF and Full Duplex bindings. This allowed the server to push updates to the clients as soon as they were available.\nBOND PRICING ENGINE (.Net via C#, F#): Architected and implemented a system that receives near real-time Bond\nMarket data, and lets the users specify parameters to an algorithm that computes Buy and Sell prices for other bonds based on\na source bond in near real-time. This system also integrates with other systems to publish this pricing data so that traders can make markets. It was built using Reactive Extensions for Stream Processing, in the back end and front end. SignalR was used\nto push updates to a Silverlight client.\nBONDS INVENTORY MANAGER (.Net via C#, F#): Architected and assisted implementing a system that allows clients to\ntrack the bonds they have in inventory, and the prices they are willing to buy and sell those bonds at. Also integrates with other systems to allow the users to do live trading of bonds. This used C#, Silverlight and Reactive Extensions in the front end, and C#, SQL Server and Stream Insight in the back end.', u'Development Manager\nGreen River Capital - West Valley City, UT\nJanuary 2010 to January 2012\nREO ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (.Net via C#): Managed the development of an asset management, workflow, and\nissue tracking system on the Microsoft Silverlight 4 platform.

Each region requires its own customer requirements and flexibility hence requires different processing logic. Also the banking operation is different hence gives different taste to the customer when uses HSBC cards across world. From overall HSBC organization perspective, this requires extra cost and support to maintain such huge region specific requirements for each business unit as business is growing rapidly day by day.\n\nTo minimize the cost and complexity of the business, HSBC has come up with ONE HSBC concept which will give customer the same HSBC feeling across globe. HSBC banking operation will be similar in all regions as much as possible with minimal region specific flexibility as per this project. To elaborate it more American HSBC customer will feel the same HSBC flavor as Europe HSBC customer. From technical point of view it will be an upgrade to a new global code layer which will support all HSBC business across global with added regional and local layer.\n\n25 segments will be created for each master file.\n\nCRS (Credit Retail Services) for North America will also be updated and upgraded to ONE HSBC layer.\nTo implement this project successfully, a global code version is accepted across all HSBC units as the base layer. Responsibilities of each business would be to adopt the base code as much as possible and put rest of enhancements either in regional layer or in local layer.

This project will prove The Hartford's Data Warehouse's historical persistent stage data can be off loaded to the Hadoop Ecosystem. Historical data is old versions of records that have not been used in multiple years. This will allow historical data to be stored on commodity hardware, which will reduce storage costs. It will also improve traditional Data Warehouse runtimes, by reducing full table scans. This project also proves that data can be migrated from Hadoop back to Oracle. An additional benefit is creating an easy to use tool that allows relational data to be migrated across environments. It will allow humans and automation tools to reliably copy data across systems. A source database, table, and target database is the only required information for starting a data copy. Apache Sqoop will be used for data transfer.

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n(LDAP) is a standard, extensible Internet protocol used to access directory services.\n\nIBM's Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) is a powerful, security-rich and standards-compliant enterprise directory for corporate intranets and the Internet. It is built to serve as the identity data foundation for rapid development and\ndeployment of Web applications and security and identity management initiatives by including strong management,\nreplication and security features.\n\nReplication is the technique of duplication data across multiple directory servers for performance, scalability and redundancy. Replication, in IBM's TDS earlier version, refers to replicating an entire sub-tree including all attributes of\neach entry in the sub-tree to the consumer server (replica server). This new feature, of filter based replication, in\nIBM's latest version of TDS, is designed to have only required entries and possibly a subset of its attributes to be\nreplicated within a subtree (replication context), based on administrator's decision. This feature gives directory\nadministrator flexibility to control which object classes and what attributes of these object classes are sent to consumer servers (partially replicating an ldap entry) by defining replication filters.\n\n\u27a2 Requirement analysis of feature by understanding competitor vendor implementation.\n\u27a2 Writing high level design for feature including unit test cases.\n\u27a2 Coding the feature as per high level design.\n\u27a2 Unit testing the feature as per written unit test cases.\n\u27a2 A new data structure class was created to hold the filters using STL sets where each filter attribute was\nstored as string.\n\u27a2 Member functions were added to access filter objects using STL set's methods like insert, erase, clear,\nsize, for-construct.\n\u27a2 Filter entry validation code, as per filter entry syntax, was written in C using standard string library routines.\n\u27a2 Logic was designed to create missing parent entry on replica and coded using C/C++ language.\n\nProject: IBM Distributed File system (IBM DFS)\nDFS is a flagship product of IBM Pittsburgh Labs (earlier called as Transarc Corporation). The Distributed Computing\nEnvironment's Distributed File Service (DCE / DFS) is a distributed client/server application that presents the DCE with a global view of a set of files and directories (a file system), independent of machine boundaries. This global\nview is called DFS file space.\n\nDFS is considered distributed because files can be physically stored on many different machines, but they are\navailable to users on every machine. DFS allows users to share files stored on computers in a network as easily as files stored on local machine. Despite this distribution of files, it still appears to users that there is a single file space.\n\nResponsibilities - As Level-3 Technical Support Engineer:\n\u27a2 Understanding customer's problem in product functioning.\n\u27a2 Re-creating the problem in lab environment.\n\u27a2 Worked on multiplatform Solaris, AIX.\n\u27a2 Troubleshooting problem in customer environment, if required.\n\u27a2 Developing the solution for problem reported by customer.\n\u27a2 Testing the developed solution.\n\u27a2 Deploying the solution in customer's environment\n\u27a2 Analyzing and investigating the client's business issues and suggests solution to those issues.\n\u27a2 Analyzing the investigation request from the clients to identify the correctness of the system for specific\nbusiness scenarios.\n\u27a2 Suggest solutions to the bugs or problems reported by the client.

Global Script-based languages lack both Fortran-style statements and side-effectful expressions; instead, facilities like file I/O and database access are requested by expressions whose values denote the I/O to be performed.\n\u2022 I've started a new implementation, based on a Global Script \u2192 Haskell translator, which will allow me to write most of the interpreter and compiler code in Global Script. By making it possible to write Global Script code directly, it should make it easier for other developers to experiment with the language.\n\u2022 The old implementation, which is the real long-term solution, is divided into three pieces: a C language library common to all languages which implements the basic calculus, a per-language C program using that library, and a set of compiler passes written in the Global Script-based language IBIO, which translate source-level Global Script to a level the C library understands. The language taken by the library (unlike GHC's intermediate formats) is purely functional, and Global Script evaluation as performed by the library has no side effects. File I/O is even performed in a different Unix process than evaluation, to ensure complete separation.\n\u2022 Keeping the language purely functional and pushing environment-dependent facilities out of the core language implementation has several advantages. Refusing to resort to side effects means that we're likely to generate more information about what can and cannot be done without them. Keeping the core language environment-independent makes it easier to guarantee that DB stored procedures or client-side scripts downloaded to the browser are incapable of performing file I/O; but having a common core language means that data structures and functions can still be re-used between stored procedures, middle-layer software, and client-side software. (This is the basic motivation behind server-side JavaScript, but I think Global Script provides a better model for that.) Along the same lines, Global Script allows model-view-controller applications to give different types to model and view code, which makes it easier to keep them separate, while still allowing them to communicate."", u'Senior Software Engineer\nGivelify - Dallas, TX\nJuly 2017 to March 2018\nPrinciple tools: Linux, Amazon AWS, Python, Selenium, Jenkins, BrowserStack, Integration Testing, PHP\nGivelify is a mobile donations provider for churches and non-profits. Its founder was inspired when, in church one day, he wanted to make an offering, but found himself without the means to do so; he realized that, since most people have their phones on them at all times, a mobile application for giving would make it more convenient for donors and increase donations for donees.\n\u2022 Developed automated integration tests using Python and Selenium, and ran them automatically through Jenkins. We experimented with using BrowserStack for tests, but found in some cases that it added an additional variable that actually made the tests less reliable than using Selenium and Firefox to run them locally on Linux.', u'Senior Software Developer\nGlobal Script Development Labs - North Richland Hills, TX\nJanuary 2014 to January 2017\nPrinciple tools: Linux, Apache, Perl, JavaScript, ActiveMQ, TDD, Unit Testing, Kanban, Scrum\neMortgage Logic (EML) provides property valuations for banks, which are used to decide whether to issue mortgages, purchase existing mortgages, or foreclose on mortgages. Most of these are Broker Price Opinions (BPOs) which are fulfilled by real estate brokers, but EML also does some Appraisals (APRs) which are fulfilled by licensed appraisers (and are between 5 and 10 times as expensive as BPOs). Banks are required to use APRs for certain decisions (in particular, loan originations) by relevant banking regulations; for other decisions, they tend to purchase BPOs for cost reasons.\n\u2022 EML has a specific business relationship with each client. It accepts orders from existing clients on its website; EML also integrates with certain larger clients via an XML-based API. EML also has a panel of brokers and appraisers; the process for finding a broker (or appraiser) to do an order is a very sensitive one. I substantially improved that process, adding auditing for the appraiser assignment process (which is highly regulated) and making sure that the best brokers or appraiser gets the order. Once the broker or appriaser fulfills the order using the EML website, the order goes through quality control; EML has automated QC checks and a manual QC team that inspects every order. An automated background process then generates a final PDF with the order information. The final PDF is always available for download through the EML website; some clients are also configured to receive PDFs by email, SFTP, or by direct upload to their server over HTTPS.\n\u2022 The EML system uses a Perl back-end and a single-page JavaScript front-end; I primarily worked on the back-end. I added substantial amounts of modularity to the system. I re-factored DB access through a dedicated persistence layer, and re-fatored business logic into a dedicated processing layer. After researching Moops (a Perl object system) online, I added Moops classes to represent the major business entities (orders and brokers) and re-factored the broker assignment system to use them. After researching DBIx::Class, I added it, as well, replacing the old persistence layer; this made the entity classes easier to write and reduced the amount of hand-written SQL in the system substantially. One mistake I made was layering the entity classes directly over the persistence layer; I should have used the repository pattern to decouple the entity classes from the storage, which would have helped with testing and given us more flexibility in changing the database structure (which was sorely needed). I extended the test coverage over the code I wrote or modified, worked on the reliability of the tests, made passing tests part of the Definition of Done, and trained the other developers to write tests for their code. I also moved the test suite to a Test::Class-based system, which gave us finer granularity when running the tests, allowed tests to be inherited where there was substantial overlap, and saved startup time.', u'Software Developer\nGlobal Script Development Labs - Irving, TX\nJuly 2013 to January 2014\nPrinciple Tools: Linux, Perl, SQLite, Integration tests, Shell, KML\nThe Train Dynamic Systems division makes train simulators for training railroad engineers. The system simulates specific track layouts, with road crossings, signals, etc. exactly where they are on the real track.\n\u2022 The railroad first sent us data with the location of tracks, signals, etc. A Perl script loaded the tracks into a SQLite database, after which the other train elements could be placed along the tracks by hand, using custom C++ tools, or loaded from customer data by additional scripts. The final databases were fed into the simulator.\n\u2022 I improved the architecture of the Perl scripts, adding domain objects for representing entities in the input file and objects being loaded or queried in the database. I added documentation and tests for the code base, but I concentrated on moving business logic and especially the somewhat-complicated processing algorithms into those modules from the scripts themselves, and ensuring functional code in the new objects was properly documented and unit-tested.\n\u2022 The purpose of the simulators was to allow engineers to drive over the tracks they would actually be working on, to ensure they have enough experience before being entrusted with an expensive train to actually drive.', u""Senior Software Engineer\nRentrak Corporation - Portland, OR\nAugust 2007 to October 2012\nPrinciple tools: Linux, Apache, Perl, speedy_cgi, Mason, Unit Tests, TDD\nRentrak did media measurement & reporting, including box office reporting (including data from 90% of theaters in America), VOD (including data from 100% of cable providers), and video/DVD rentals & retail sales. I worked on the Linear TV reporting product, which was a relatively new effort to take over the live TV & DVR ratings business from Nielsen. I worked on rating measurement & calculations as well as incorporating demographics into the system.\n\u2022 The back-end, written in C++, received content views from a variety of TV providers (such as AT&T U-Verse and Dish), and loaded summarized data into a central Postgres DB. I mostly worked on the middle layer, which built reporting based on that DB. We used an object-oriented reporting system, with page controller objects for layout, built from re-usable self-rendering component objects, and report objects for querying the database, built from re-usable SQL generation code and post-query Perl calculation logic.\n\u2022 Generally speaking, pages used the same layout for HTML, Excel, and PDF output. We used Mason directly to generate HTML, and we had separate Mason templates for Excel and PDF which were post-processed to produce binary data. Our network customers usually preferred to print our generated Excel files to give to advertisers and ad agencies, so we paid a lot of attention to the appearance of the Excel files when prined.\n\u2022 We had a module that took a summary table, any selected filters, and group by list and automatically selected the aggregation method for each column. For example, the network/day summary table might be used to calculate average audience for a single network and day, for a single network and a whole week, or for a set of networks and a single day; the calculation framework would automatically generate SQL to take the value off the table in the first case, to average in the second, and to sum it in the third.\n\u2022 Because our data was based on vastly more data points than Nielsen's, we were able to provide ratings to many low-rated cable networks more cheaply than they could. Additionally, our ratings were more stable than theirs were, for those networks; for example, one network switched to our data after discovering that they'd lost a large fraction of their ratings because Nielsen removed one of their viewers from its sample. We were also able to define smaller and more precise demographics; for example, for a $100k+ HH Income bucket for a network targeting high-income viewers."", u'Research Assistant\nUniversity of Oklahoma - Norman, OK\nJanuary 2001 to January 2003\nPrinciple tools: Haskell\nThis project was for an experiment with replacing the standard Discrete Math curriculum for Computer Science students with a functional programming/software reasoning course.

And, we are also spending a portion of our time building a multi-purpose (but reasonably constrained) extensible full-stack platform for the SaaS efforts that continue to grow. Notable clients include Salesforce.com, Starbucks and Premera Blue Cross.\n\nOur most recent engagement with Salesforce yielded a side project we are excited about called Slam, where we've simplified Dependency Injection without impacting developer time and reducing code complexity. https://github.com/patrickdenglerhobbisoft/Slam"", u'Chief Software Architect\nOmniM2m - Bellevue, WA\nJanuary 2014 to January 2015\nOmniM2m, Bellevue, Wash. 2014 - 2015\nAs the sole architect/engineer, later complimented by one contractor, I built the first device independent, scenario specific, globalized and localized, 3rd party extensible and end-user customizable platform for IoT running on mobile devices and Web. In those seven months, I drew upon my deep experience in building developer platforms (.Net, MEF, Visual Studio) and software platforms (MS-CRM, ONYX, Office Extensibility). We received a letter of intent for acquisition valued at $10 million.', u""Architect / Program Manager Lead\nMicrosoft, Redmond, Wash\nJanuary 1992 to January 2014\nWindows and Internet Explorer\nMy most recent assignment at Microsoft started with Microsoft's decision to re-invest in the Windows operating system and Internet Explorer, where I reentered the individual contributor role and attempted to win back a significant portion of the developer mindshare. My role was to collaborate with intuitive thinkers and realign the Windows core graphics engine to align with DirectX, in order to prepare Internet Explorer (IE) and Windows for new and evolving industry standards graphics technologies to enable an entirely new visual experience. As a part of the industry standards commitments, I enjoyed the opportunity to participate as a contributing editor to the SVG specification, as well as helping spearhead CSS FX. I wrote many demos for IE, delivered guidance to developers on SVG and other graphics technologies, wrote the vision for HTML6, and was invited to present at TPAC, making a final exit as keynote speaker on SVG Graphics.\n\nAfter completing the raw engineering cycles for Internet Explorer 9 and 10, and Windows 8 and\n8.1, I pursued the opportunity to work with top partners such as Facebook, Twitter, eBay,\nFlipboard, Adobe, Nick (media), and several gaming companies, to prepare, develop and deliver Windows applications. This exciting opportunity allowed us to get close with partner engineers before products shipped, as well as influential decision makers and executives, to help them embrace the new technologies. Through this effort, we were able to demonstrate, either through diagrams or raw code, how to build great applications, as well as organize their development efforts to reuse as much of their existing assets for earlier devices, all while crossing languages, skillsets, and technologies. Through utilizing internal core feature design and engineering, partner adoption and application-building support and insight, and most importantly, reattracting partners in Windows engineering and design, we were often successful in stabilizing and improving products before they shipped. Significant changes I personally introduced included an overhaul of the Window search experience and technology that adapts websites to browsers dynamically that greatly reduces software failures (all four patents filed are pending).\n\nVisual Studio\nI participated in three iterations of Visual Studio. The first began in 1997, finishing Visual Interdev 1, through Visual Studio .NET. My primary effort was to design and deliver what is now the Visual Studio shell, including all of the data run-time and design time tools, as well as the Web projects and services model. Recognizing the need to pull database developers into the Visual Studio experience, I designed, coded, delivered and patented the first SQL Source Code control integration.\n\nIn addition to our core innovation, .NET, my team, through innovations in Visual Interdev, invented and delivered what is now common practice in the modern day web: web services. My role expanded broadly, both directly and indirectly managing the efforts of over 100 engineers. In addition to the design time experiences, I invented - in conjunction with thought leaders such as Anders Hejlsberg, John Shewchuck, and Brad Lovering, and crossing several data teams inside of Microsoft - a new programming model for stateless systems; specifically, a new data runtime model called ADO.NET, which later evolved into LINQ. Rounding out this experience, I also designed and delivered the designers and run-time to support drag-and-drop RAD model of creating applications with data.\n\nMy second tour in Visual Studio, my role was architect on the core Visual Studio team responsible for the shell and the extensibility model. Here, I managed to bring together disparate efforts on evolving a component model to compete with products such as Eclipse. By huddling with big thinkers in these different technology groups, we worked together to find both common goals and to lift best practices and ideas from each other. Though years later than the initial .NET effort, I finished what was started with the disconnected, yet object-oriented model of Web Services (which eventually became SOAP); I invented and delivered an abstraction of traditional component models that allow any language, on any platform, to bind to any version and any object either at design time, or through discovery and pattern matching contracts at run time. This managed extensibility framework (MEF) technology, ) is now the core object model for Visual Studio proper. MEF reduces the cost and eliminates version problems and future proofing for tools that integrate into Visual Studio. This includes our own internal Microsoft editors, tools windows, project models, and projects, such as SQL Management Studio and Microsoft Office.\n\nMy third and final tour in Visual Studio was another entrepreneurial endeavor, where I was charged with defining a new product to compete with emerging RAD technologies, such as Ruby on Rails. My team was responsible for a ground-up compete analysis and product definition and delivery, which eventually shipped as Visual Studio Lightswitch.\n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions\nHaving successfully defined the Customer Reporting Manager (CRM) category through my successful ONYX Startup (see following), I was asked to re-architect a struggling new CRM product that Microsoft was building. The team was challengingly comprised of a hodgepodge of obscure acquisitions of teams that often did not see eye to eye. Additionally, the original architecture was dangerously in peril and doomed to failure as its design prohibited scale-out, an important feature for the emerging Software as a Service (SAAS) landscape. While the pressure to ship eventually pushed this product out the door earlier than desired, my efforts in both architecture across the systems, and leading the teams to understand best practices and features for CRM - including the need for offline access and simple synchronization - led to the delivery of Microsoft CRM 1.0. Feeling optimistic that Microsoft CRM 1.0 had the potential to evolve, I continued to advise on version 2.0, while I examined technologies and orchestrated global efforts across recent acquisitions of Great Plains and Navision. I had to make the difficult decision to shut down a four-year effort of Great Plains, who was attempting to design a business entity framework that was woefully under thought and over designed, in favor of a better technology, begun by Navision. Collectively, we prototyped and shipped an integrated .NET style cross-purpose Business Suite (Dynamics) that embraced our technology, existing languages, and tools, and thus advanced the skills of our development customers."", u""Development Lead\nONYX Software, Bellevue, Wash\nJanuary 1994 to January 1997\nAfter only two years at Microsoft, a great opportunity presented itself and I made the difficult decision to join some respected colleagues who were going to start their own enterprise software company. Those three, the founders of ONYX Software, pioneered the CRM market, and collectively we delivered a new vertical into the software industry. As one among only two or three developers at any given time, I was responsible for developing versions 1.0 through 2.5 of the ONYX flagship product, Customer Center. Following on our first few years of success, I envisioned and created a supplementary line of products including Seeker, the first indexable online search for technical support, which extracted tagged cases from the CRM system. More importantly, I designed and created the world's first commercial enterprise Web software, Web Wizards, for Sales, and Web Wizards for Marketing, which extracted company rules, definitions and configurations to surface web interfaces to surveys and product support. ONYX was a huge success and in its initial IPO (in 1999) was valued at over $1 billion.""]","[u'Masters in Computer Science in Computer Science', u'B.A. in Economics']","[u'University of Washington\nJanuary 2007', u'University of California Berkeley Berkeley, CA\nJanuary 1992']","degree_1 : Masters in Compter Science in Compter Science, degree_2 :  B.A. in Economics"

The system applies the main line of EBS enterprise-class service, delivers the massages to periphery systems and uses open resource task engine to control the procedure and leads the stuff into the business process. The human task manager starts some steps, through which the staff could be transferred as a kind of service. Based on the SOA framework, all subsystems and other periphery systems of Shanxi Mobile will be integrated, which offers support to the core functions of other systems, makes announcements to the service as well as passes the procedures through different systems.', u'Senior software engineer, system architect\nPCCW Solution\nFebruary 2009 to August 2010\nTools for development: Eclipse3.2+Liferay4.3\nDescription: The ongoing Beijing mobile supply management system is to informationize the procurement information of Beijing Mobile. In this project, I mainly provided the architectural design of personnel information, and the networked personnel information design of personnel, company, departments, cost centers, and a series of basic data, and synchronized the personnel of other systems through technologies like LDAP.', u'Technical manager, system architect\nPCCW Solution\nOctober 2009 to May 2010\nTools for development: Eclipse3.2+Liferay4.3+DB2\nDescription: This project mainly deals with the budget management system of China Mobile, including strategic planning and goal-setting, business planning and budgeting, budget auditing and decomposition, budget execution and control, budget adjustments, budget reporting and analysis, performance evaluation and incentive, etc. The technologies applied included: jQuery validation framework, Flexigrid and the CXF WebService development. jQuery Validation is mainly responsible for submitting the form validation; Flexigrid is the exhibition of table data; CXF mainly transfers data to peripheral system; in performance, the modjk, using Apache (Solaris 10) achieves load balancing of Tongweb server. In this project, I was primarily in charge of the management of all technical work, encapsulating and redeveloping all the tools used, as well as the development and refinement of the formulation standards, as well as the introduction of code quality management detection mechanisms (e.g. Findbugs, JUnit), which were effectively integrated into the project management process.\n\u03bd. Through the forming system development instruments, such as Eclipse, Eclipse plug-ins, Ant, system scripts, and self-developing tools, etc, I made developers to initialize the development environment in the shortest time, and put the maximum energy into the business logic development, which minimizes the project development risk and reduces the development costs.\n\u03bd. I integrated and optimized such dozens of open component frameworks as Spring, Hibernate, Struts 1, jQuery to achieve high encapsulation of common business functions.', u'Project manager, system architect\nPCCW Solution\nAugust 2008 to August 2009\nTools for development: Eclipse3.2 + Oracle9i\nDescription: As a project manager, I independently led the crew to develop online combination adjusting, and the main function of this project is the single sign-on and the backlog integration. The single sign-on mainly calls Oracle core API, while the backlog integration is mainly to integrate purchase orders, purchase requisitions, and storage and EX-storage in ERP. The technology is realized in the way that JSP calls PLSQL, and because the server in ERP environment is Apache Jserv, jdk1.4 is used to develop projects. The design mainly involves the architecture of the projects, the declaration and call of the service, takes full advantage of SOA design concept, makes unified publishing, management, and subscriptions of the interface, and uses JMS, JMX to realize the asynchronous messages transfer of heterogeneous systems for OA platform. The difficulty of this project lies in the fact that I have to organize communication with suppliers and mobile customers in 31 provinces, and be responsible for making all UAT documentation, user manuals and on-line confirmation reports while developing to overcome the difficulties and lead my crew to successfully complete the on-line work of these 31 provinces.', u'Senior software engineer, system architect\nPCCW Solution\nMay 2008 to July 2008\nTools for development: Eclipse3.2+Liferay4.3+Oracle9i+ Websphere\nDescription: This project mainly involved the inventory module development of Shanghai Mobile, whose key functions include inventory counts, inventory write-offs, and quality control, as well as financial reconciliation. It still used the Liferay framework, and the difference lay in executing the logic mostly in the way that JAVA calls PLSQL, utilizing the open source tools of Barcode4j to generate barcodes, and printing barcodes directly by using JavaScript. I served as SA in this project, from which I slowly began to engage in some architectural work.', u""Senior software engineer\nPCCW Solution\nMarch 2008 to May 2008\nTools for development: Eclipse3.2+Liferay4.3+Oracle9i\nDescription: This project was mainly the peripheral system of the financial modules. It is only a demo, but already fulfills this project's main functions, such as employee and travel expense reimbursement, provision management, supplier reimbursement, as well as the synchronization with ERP system data. This project was mainly related to process management. I was primarily responsible for the development of this process, the encapsulation of JBPM, to decrease the developers' unnecessary amount of codes in the development process in the labeling way, slowly engaging in some public module development as well as the encapsulation for the common codes."", u""Senior software engineer\nPCCW Solution\nAugust 2007 to March 2008\nTools for development: Eclipse3.2+Liferay4.3+Mysql\nDescription: This project was the main system used for company's facade systems and internal management. In the initial stage, I was solely in charge of establishing the basic framework, technology and functional research. This system mainly includes Time Sheet, contract and project management, fixed assets management and human resource management, employee information and the processing of management for leave requests. It mainly used Liferay framework (Liferay framework, a bigger framework, adopts most of the more popular open source tools at present), with such mainly relevant technologies as JQuery and JBPM. I laid the foundation for the project that enabled the integration of JBPM and Liferay to become the universal use process, and also cultivated a group of new colleagues who specialized in the process development."", u'software engineer\nPCCW Solution\nApril 2007 to August 2007\nTools for development: Eclipse+Liferay4.2+Oracle9i+Ariba\nProject Description: This project was my first project in the company, mainly aimed at the centralized procurement and reverse auctions of the China Mobile Group, this project was the system used for censuring and maintaining each competitive tender of supply and material information. I was mainly engaged in the supplier information input function and the follow-up maintenance. This function is the independent Portlet module, and Liferay framework mainly integrates Struts and Hibernate and Spring. In this project, I learned some skills like POI tool import and the WS data synchronized with other peripheral systems. Participating in the development of this project gave me a deeper understanding of Liferay framework and the use of open source tools, which has laid a good foundation for future project development.']","[u'Master in Information management', u'Diploma in Harbin', u'Bachelor in English']","[u'Dongbei University of Finance and Economics Master Dalian, CN\nSeptember 2015 to March 2018', u'Harbin Institute of Technology\nMarch 2012 to July 2015', u'Beijing USA College Of English Beijing, CN\nSeptember 2002 to July 2006']","degree_1 : Master in Information management, degree_2 :  Diploma in Harbin, degree_3 :  Bachelor in English"
