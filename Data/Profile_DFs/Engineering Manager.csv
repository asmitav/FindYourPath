The outboards could be changed out quickly returning the vessels to a ready status much quicker than earlier propulsion systems, boosting operational readiness ratings.\n\nThe project was initiated based on Coast Guard requirements and objectives including logistics support, life cycle support, configuration management, warranty management, trend analysis and technical support for the Honda 225 and 150 HP engines used on these Defender Class vessels and Aids to Navigation vessels. Objectives of the of the program included reduction in spare engine inventories, maximize operational readiness, minimize mean time to repair and warranty management. The maintenance was broken down into two catagories-0rganizationalLevel-done by the units and depot level done under contract.\n\nMeasurable objectives were established based on number of assets enrolled in the program, number of engines determined to be non- repairable, warranty considerations and procurement of new assets.\nOver 80 stake holders were initially identified, and their expectations and impact were determined. The large number of stake holders made communication planning and risk management challenging.\n\nThe Coast Guard issued a statement of work describing the scope which included metrics, through put and inspection standards. Budget estimates were developed based on the implementation process required by the Coast Guard. One of the interesting aspects of this project is that the Coast Guard attached to an existing Customs sand Border Protection contract adding stake holders and a different set of requirements.\n\nThe program produces ready for issue assets on a continuing basis, meeting quality requirements for the product. Our parts management system includes ten percent inventories monthly and a 100 percent inventory once a year which yield results over 99 percent accuracy (Includes tools and GFE).\nThe only drop in operational readiness is based on the time it takes the Coast Guard to change out engines and perform organizational level maintenance. At one-time Honda engines powered two thirds of the Coast Guard surface fleet.\n\nDuties include providing technical administrative and operational leadership to project and tasks. Supervise subordinate supervisors and technical staff. Perform high level technical support. Develop technical proposals, reports as well as administrative reports.

Also, I supervised redesigning and relocating product manufacturing cells, process methods to improve productivity and throughput. Under my leadership, we were able to emphasize the engineering requirements of its traditional business, thereby, increasing both the sales and profitability of this company.', u'Director of Manufacturing Engineering\nHarvard Industries, Inc\nJuly 1999 to November 2000\nDirector of Manufacturing Engineering for a group with $140 million in revenue, consisting of two die cast and two machining divisions. I was responsible for planning and developing manufacturing cells for new and existing products, managing the design and purchase of equipment to construct these cells. I also managed the projects including schedules, time charts and related cost. I met regularly with field personnel to verify progress of each project and in most cases, directed the actual cell layout and construction at the site.\n\nInvestigated new technology and visited OEM equipment suppliers and fabricators to confirm the equipment cycle times and accurate operation. I worked with the sales group to investigate potential customer components and related manufacturing methods. My background in project management, machinery design, maintenance operations, AutoCAD software, PLC function and capital cost accounting was necessary to complete tasks and reach goals.\n\nMy initial assignment required the launch of a $10 million shaft line at 20% operating profit. Harvard purchased the equipment and entered into a manufacturing contract agreement for a marine product line in Wisconsin. I managed the new manufacturing cell designs and facility arrangement to perform this work at our plant site in Iowa. I was charged to oversee equipment transfers, cell layout and installation. This project was successfully completed and we manufactured shafts on a contract basis.\n\nOn another project, we had a high scrap rate from outsourcing and subsequent grinding of the plated seal areas on shafts. I investigated the issue and managed the purchase and installation of a carbide spray booth to perform the work in-house and eliminate the substandard plating method. The improved process resulted in higher quality, improved throughput, unit cost reduction and elimination of scrap losses.', u'Manager of Engineering, Facilities, Maintenance and Design\nConforma Clad, Inc\nMay 1990 to July 1999\nWhen I started with Conforma Clad, we were a small ""coatings-only"" operation with approximately 30 employees. I initially engineered the facility expansion and acquisition of plant operating equipment. This included the nuts and bolts electrical wiring and mechanical operating requirements. While performing my duties as plant engineer, I also managed the outsourcing for component fabrication, machining and grinding. Eventually, we vertically integrated into machining and grinding cells to produce a turn-key component in-house. We grew to over 150 employees. I organized an engineering group to manage the growth.\n\nAs expansion, one product line required a plant in Florida. I investigated, located and acquired a 30,000 sq ft facility in Melbourne, Florida. I had the facility gutted and engineered a new floor, equipment foundations, cranes, operating equipment and the necessary material handling equipment to meet a 6 month schedule from start to finish, thus providing the industry with a revolutionary carbide coated and machined extrusion die. The component was successful and led to a partnership with a leading competitor.\n\nDuring this growth period, I designed and built the necessary manufacturing equipment not available in the marketplace and managed the maintenance for the plant equipment. This included an organized plant equipment evaluation and numerical tracking system.\n\nI resigned from this position in July 1999 to join the newly founded Harvard Group, thus enjoying improved benefits and pay with a potential for growth. I left my position in good relations with the owners.', u'Engineering Manager, Technical and Design Engineering\nHarpring, Inc\nAugust 1987 to May 1990\nThis was a transitional job following my employment with the CSX Railroad. When I began this job, I also had a consulting business on the side to supplement my income. The consulting business was primarily with the Railroad Industry. After departing CSX RR, CSX utilized my consulting services in the design and fabrication of machinery and material handling equipment for car and locomotive repairs and rebuilds.\n\nHarpring employed the largest number of organized sheet metal workers in Kentucky with most employees working in the field. My primary job was to design and direct engineering activities in preparing the necessary engineering drawings for fabrication and installation of a variety of metal fabricated products. I went to the field on many occasions to supervise projects.\n\nI brought a new dimension to the Harpring Company. We ventured into equipment design and fabrication. Initially, we were in an 8000 sf facility. Within one year, we relocated to a 50,000 sf facility. I handled the relocation, including equipment evaluation and acquisitions while performing my other duties. I interviewed and added six new personnel to a newly organized engineering group. This included a new automated metal punch and forming department.\n\nOnce the engineering department was functional, I traveled with sales to promote our services and also aid the customer in new methods and designs to achieve their objectives.\n\nI resigned this position for improved pay and benefits and the future potential of the unique ""carbide coatings"" company, Conforma Clad. I left my position in good relations with the Harpring owners.', u""Senior Facilities Engineer\nCSX Transportation, Inc\nNovember 1969 to May 1987\nThis job was a design engineer's dream. I worked at the major locomotive and repair shop for the L&N Railroad Company. I began as a sheet metal worker. Within two years, I was given a job in the plant engineer's office. We had two machine shops and two fabricating departments. The total facility covered 52 acres with 1,000,000 sf under roof.\n\nI evaluated repair and reclamation cells, prepared and presented capital investment plans for improved cell rearrangement, including design and fabrication of fixtures and machinery to supplement the improved material handling. I designed and managed the installation of equipment, cranes and other material handling systems. I initiated the first PLC installation for L&N. I was promoted several times: Design Engineer, Project Engineer, Facilities Engineer and Senior Engineer. Over the years, I developed the department from two to six designers.\n\nAfter several mergers and finally becoming CSX, I was traveling to all outlying points and managing facility improvements, capital equipment needs and upgrading manufacturing methods. After merging with CSX, the Louisville, KY plant was closed and operations moved to Huntington, West Virginia. I was given the opportunity to take the position of Senior Facilities Engineer.
