I stepped into a role there that was the lead architect on various projects from day one, and in that role until I left the organization. Following is a list of some of the projects and accomplishments, both the team and myself, were presented with throughout my time with them.\n\nIn addition to the major projects listed below, here are a few highlights that were outside the scope of those projects:\n\n\u2022 Designed and deployed four new SDLC environments to replace the existing environments as their configuration drift was too great due to lack of maintenance over the years. The design included full architectural specifications as well as environmental governance classifications and definitions.\n\u2022 Designed and deployed a integration system to provide build automation, better source code entry point into the build process, build artifact management, automated hooks for testing, and overall, better control of the software development lifecycle.\n\u2022 Started to generate standard containers and container templates for deploying new instances of existing applications, as well as new applications whose resource profile allowed. The container technologies implemented within the various environments consisted of Docker and LXC containers.\n\u2022 Deployed Vagrant to provide customized systems for development purposes. This allowed for faster turn around and benefited the team during times when there was a high priority build or integration that needed to be produced.\n\u2022 Once we had SailPoint fully deployed, we moved from the ant-based build system to a maven-based system. After that had settled, we then migrated to Gradle and standardized on that platform as the core build system for the overall integration pipeline and system.\nSun Identity Management Platform Optimization and Maintenance:\nMy first individual responsibility was to assume the role of application owner to the Sun Identity Manager system. This include the core system as well as ownership of all interfaces to all downstream and/or connected systems and applications. Following is a list of some of the subprojects that were completed as part of general maintenance or adding new functionality to the application.\n\n\u2022 Designed and implemented a pull-based mechanism for data feed processing from the identity authoritative source within Sun Identity Manager. This consisted of two python frameworks and standard system shell scripts to accomplish.\n\n\u2022 Restructured the codebase within the main processing forms for the authoritative identity source within Sun Identity Manager to consolidate the number of calls to various scripts and libraries. The\nnet result was a more streamlined form allowing for faster processing of each record in the source\nfeed.\n\n\u2022 Analyzed and redesigned a significant number of the existing workflows to improve the performance of provisioning and de-provisioning as well as allow for greater flexibility in regards to event scheduling and such.\n\n\u2022 Redesigned the public facing component of Sun Identity Manager so that there was no externally exposed area of the architecture. This allowed for simpler access policies(PnP policies) as well as easier overall administration and maintenance.\n\n\u2022 Designed and implemented a migration plan for moving Sun Identity Manager 7.0 running on a 32-bit JVM over to a 64-bit JVM. The JVM used was Oracle-based. This allowed for more optimized Java configuration parameters to be passed by the application to the JVM at application initialization.\n\n\u2022 Supported and maintained the enterprise source code repository for the Sun Identity Manager application. This included all development branches for all of the custom functionalities implemented(as well as not) within the application.\n\nVirtual Directory Service Deployment\nLightweight Directory Services Deployment\nAter the merger between Baylor and Scott and White Health was complete, we starte the design phase for a virtual directory service to allow for better flexibility as resources began to transfer and migrate between the various business units.\n\n\u2022 Implemented AD LDS in DMZ to allow vendor applications to be able to generate necessary profile information within their application from the data that was exposed within the AD LDS implementation. This was later replaced by a Radiant Logic enterprise solution.\n\nVirtual Directory Service Deployment\nThis was really the second phase of the Lightweight Directory Services deployment project. Where that project began, the Virtual Directory Service deployment project finalized and streamlined the overall system in a way that made it accessible to virtually any enterprise application that had a need to utilize some type of data view that VDS could present.\n\nEnterprise Migration From OpenSSO to SecureAuth\nWorked with application owners as well as various business units and partners to coordinate the migration of existing service providers controlled by OpenSSO, over to the new SecureAuth platform. We were able to do this in a way that had zero downtime and provided better functionality and performance than the previous system.\n\n\u2022 The most challenging piece to this was decoupling OpenSSO from Sun Identity Manager as it was running as the Access Manager role. This required and exhaustive code review of all actively deployed code to ensure that there would be no negative impact once we split the two systems. The project was a complete success.\n\nIdentity Management Redeployment Project (SailPoint IdentityIQ)\nThe Idenitty Management Redeployment(IDMR) project was really the project that I was queried on during the interview process prior to starting employment with BSWH. It was already well known that the Sun Identity Manager system need to be replaced as it had reached end-of-life two years prior.\n\nAfter the successful go-live of phase one for central Texas, I was one of the three people on the original team to be recipients of Baylor's Service Excellence Award for exceptional performance during that stage of the project.\n\n\u2022 Worked as part of a project team that generated criteria for a formal RFP process that was approved by senior leadership. The process leading up to the final draft involved collaboration with stakeholders and various business units and interested parties. The final draft of this process was executed and led to the selection of the new solution that would be implemented.\n\n\u2022 Worked as part of a project team that coordinated with our business partner, as well as internal\nstakeholders, to design and develop a project plan to replace the Sun Identity Manager implementation with a new IdentityIQ solution from SailPoint.\n\n\u2022 Designed and implemented the infrastructure architecture component of the IdentityIQ deployment\nproject. This encompassed three environments at first and was later expanded to four with a fifth\nbeing considered.\n\n\u2022 Worked with the project team to assist in designing the overall application layer logic for the initial\nrollout of the IdentityIQ application. This was a very detailed and highly envolved process that involved all stakeholders and touched almost every aspect of the business.\n\n\u2022 Worked with the project team as well as with our business partner to development and implement the various components necessary to support the application architecture that was approved. This involved the creation of rules, rule libraries, workflows, etc as well as the necessary application and\nconnected system interfaces as depicted within the overall architecture.\n\n\u2022 Personally wrote the code for many of the core functiona libraries in IdentityIQ. The included the core codebase for the joiner process, leaver process, mover process(aka, change manger), leave of absence, immediate termination, and more. We worked very closely with our business partner and SailPoint implementation services during this types of sprints.\n\n\u2022 Designed an initial role hierarchy for role-based access control that was later expanded upon while working with the project team and various other resources that were brought in for peer and other\ntypes of design review.\n\n\u2022 Designed and deployed the initial configuration and schema for the various application interfaces within the IdentityIQ application deployment for phase one of the project.\n\n\u2022 Coordinated with database management team to implement the IdentityIQ repository database. This was an Oracle 11G R2 database running on AIX. There were three initial databases, one for each of our SDLC environments, and was later expanded to include a fourth database to service a specialized data mining environment."", u'Systems Architect\nCB Richard Ellis, Inc - Dallas, TX\nApril 2013 to August 2013\nPrimary focus while at CBRE was corporate identity management and federation as well as access management and system integration design. Technologies used were ADFS 2.0, FIM 2010 R2, AD DS, AD LDS, AD RMS, and AD CS.\nMicrosoft Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2:\nDesigned and deployed FIM within the environment as an initial POC\nMoved from POC to pilot phase where we deployed the Office 365 connector that was not yet publicly available through our premiere agreement that allowed pre-public release access to the code for the connector.\nSuccessfully synched identities into the Office 365 cloud from US, EMEA, and APAC regions.\nBegan initial design process for the workflow component of FIM to allow Enterprise processes to be more streamlined and to provide business automation in areas where previously it did not exist(ie, group modification authorization workflow, new user provisioning workflow, etc )\nActive Directory Domain Services (AD DS, deployed by default)\nWas responsible for the global DNS environment at CBRE\nBoth intra-site and inter-site replication optimization\nDFS-R implementation and migration of sysvol\nDNS Application partition migration and optimization\nDNS Zone implementation and consolidation\nActive Directory Federation Services 2.0 (AD FS)\nAD FS was deployed to help provide extranet SSO and implement claims-based authentication for various internal development initiatives.\nActive Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)\n\u2022 Implemented AD LDS to provide identity synchronization between sharepoint environments both internally as well as in extranet environments.\n\u2022 Implemented AD LDS to provide a consolidated view of multiple domains and forests for Cisco UCM and Cisco UCS\n\u2022 To strengthen the security posture of their existing extranet, as well as to help consolidate identity management in that environment as well.\n\u2022 To provide an integration point for non-Microsoft-based systems that allowed them to communicate back to the primary directory service, thus consolidating multiple authentication stores into one.\n\nIn addition to the items mentioned, another(if not obvious) benefit was integration of POSIX systems with Microsoft Active Directory Services in regards to providing a central authentication store that was/is consistent across the entire agency\nActive Directory Certification Services (AD CS)\nBegan the design process to upgrade and strengthen multiple PKI infrastructures at CBRE', u'Systems Architect\nBonneville Power Administration - Portland, OR\nJune 2011 to February 2013\nMain responsibilities are centered around developing custom super computing solutions on both x86 and SPARC based platforms utilizing Solaris 10, and various distributions of Linux.\nDirectory Services Architectural Redesign and Deployment\nProject Consisted of 3 Phases:\n\u2022 Planning Phase\n\u2022 Implementation Phase\n\u2022 Maintenance Phase\nComponent Details:\nI was responsible for designing a Active Directory architecture that implemented many of the newer generation, and advanced functions found within the current ADS offerings. these were as follows:\nActive Directory Domain Services (AD DS, deployed by default)\nThe AD DS deployment within BPA was where to core of the Active Directory Modernization project payload was delivered. Substantial work was done to optimize the following:\n\n\u2022 Both intra-site and inter-site replication optimization\n\u2022 DFS-R implementation and migration of sysvol\n\u2022 DNS Application partition migration and optimization\n\u2022 DNS Zone implementation and consolidation\n\u2022 DNS Global Namespace implementation\n\u2022 FIM design and implementation to assist with workflow and identity management.\nActive Directory Federation Services 2.0 (AD FS)\nAD FS was deployed to help provide extranet SSO and implement claims-based authentication for various internal development initiatives.\nActive Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)\nThe purpose of deploying AD LDS within the environments at BPA were threefold:\n\n\u2022 To strengthen the security posture of their existing extranet, as well as to help consolidate identity management in that environment as well.\n\u2022 To provide an integration point for non-Microsoft-based systems that allowed them to communicate back to the primary directory service, thus consolidating multiple authentication stores into one.\n\u2022 To provide identity management for Oracle based systems that resided in the middle tier. This was primarily for applications such as PeopleSoft, Asset Suite, Sunflower, etc\n\nIn addition to the items mentioned, another(if not obvious) benefit was integration of POSIX systems with Microsoft Active Directory Services in regards to providing a central authentication store that was/is consistent across the entire agency\nActive Directory Certification Services (AD CS)\nAD CS was deployed in a three-tier architecture to provide core PKI services to the internal divisions of BPA.\nAll aspects of this implementation had to comply with numerous federal regulations as the first two tiers, and all root CAs were cross-signed by the Federal DOE PKI and tied back in to one of the Federal PKI bridge that the DOE is anchored too.\nAll system builds associated with this section of the project were STIG compliant. The STIGs used for this were NSA and DISA.\n\nAnother item to mention here is that the design took into account dependencies outside of the project and design to those as ""soft requirements"" as the project allowed. The end result of this added effort, was faster ""time to market"" for the exchange deployment team, the respect that much of the site replication calculations and design work was already done for them and required very little if no change at all.\n\nExadata Infrastructure Design and Deployment\nFor this project, I designed the management environment, as well as all of the infrastructure elements leading up to the demarcation point between the prod environment, and the database machines internals. I also worked with the various business units as well as the database design team to generate the overall Exadata capacity plan and overall architecture. In the end, we went with the following configuration:\n\n\u2022 1 Exadata release 2 Full Rack\n\u2022 2 Exadata release 2 Half Racks\n\u2022 2 Exadata release 2 Quarter Racks\nDuties and Duties and Responsibilities\n\u2022 Maintain Exadata Machine, including patching, database nodes, storage cells, hardware components and infini bandswitches\n\u2022 Executed project management, technical lead and liaison responsibilities between business user and technical group\n\u2022 Install Oracle 11g Enterprise Grid Control and Oracle Web Logic server, configure multiple RAC, stand-alone and standby Oracle databases, and install Exadata Plug-in to monitor Exadata Storage cells in Grid Control\n\u2022 Move Oracle Database Server Farm from Sacramento, CA to Las Vegas, NV data center\n\u2022 Created and implemented load balancer for performance and fail over utilization\n\u2022 Setup Oracle 10g Grid Control Management Server, installing and capturing Oracle databases on Sun Solaris 10 servers\n\u2022 Planned and implemented Disaster Recovery site for Oracle databases in Las Vegas using Oracle Data Guard, creating standby logical databases for real-time data replication\n\u2022 Assisted database administration team in the conversion and replacement of custom backup/recovery Unix scripts to RMAN\n\u2022 Recommended standards and procedures for development, deployment, version control, source code management, change control process and capacity planning functions, suggesting tools to eliminate 40-50% of development time\n\u2022 Provided innovative strategies for better database administration, maintenance, tuning and backup\nEnvironment:\n\u2022 1 Exadata (Release 2) Full Rack.

Not wanting to live with this long term, we decided to virtualize Solaris 10, on top of Solaris 11 via Oracle VM Server for SPARC where necessary while still allowing us to standardize on Solaris 11 moving forward.\nApplication Stack Design Criteria\n\u2022 Oracle PeopleSoft\n\u2022 Ventech Asset Suite\n\u2022 Sunflower Systems Asset Management\n\u2022 Oracle Weblogic Server\n\u2022 Microsoft Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services(as a component of the ADM project listed above) as an identity broker between the Oracle environments and the Microsoft systems.\nEnvironment\n\u2022 4 SPARC Enterprise T4-2 Servers\n\u2022 Oracle VM Server for SPARC\n\u2022 Oracle VM Server\n\u2022 Solaris 11 (Host Layer)\n\u2022 Solaris 10 (Guest/Application Layer)\n\nPuppet Enterprise Pre-Cloud Architecture and Deployment\nI was given the opportunity to design the base architecture for the deployment of Puppet Enterprise 2.x to provide configuration management on a comprehensive level throughout the agency.

The customer relationship in-scope for the InvestLend (IVL) conversion is Confidential Client North America #1 (CCNA1). CCNA1, the largest institutional lender on the street, is largely serviced by the Directed Lending Operations group (DLO) in California for all of their lending activity.

SWIFT Hub intelligently routes internal SWIFT messages to the business units within State Street. In the preceding architecture, there were sub flows for SWIFT transformation and it's distribution. Any change in the SWIFT distribution functionality or addition of new SWIFT standards used to require heavy development activity. With the development of SWIFT Hub, all the transformation and its subsequent distribution to various applications are exposed as services. Any change in SWIFT distribution rule or any addition of new SWIFT standard doesn't need any change in the client specific message flows. Client sets the Meta data values in MQRFH and sends canonical XML to the SWIFT Hub. The Delegation service retrieves the values in metadata and drives the Transformation and distribution service.

MIS also wanted to own the ability to change the transformation rule for the final XML output. MQSI solution to achieve the objective, make use of database to store the Meta data information. Once the data is transformed to Canonical XML, it makes use of XSL files to transform Canonical XML to the required Black Box XML format. XSL files are deployed on the web server which is owned by MIS. It gives them liberty to change the transformation rule.

The Transfer agency platform consists of several interfaces: Dealing Orders: Allows TA to accept orders (15022 Swift MT502(message for Ordering to buy, sell or switch)) sent via Swift Network. Received orders are acknowledged with Swift MT509(message for trade status). Upon pricing and confirmation MT515 (message for trade confirmation) is sent to the clients. Batch Dealing Order: allows Transfer Agency business to accept orders from non-swift clients. This interface supports clients using proprietary formats like RBC Dexia, GFS, Merryl Lynch etc Payments: Provides straight through processing for Transfer Agency payments by sending 15022 Swift MT103 (message for money transfer) and MT202 (message for delivering money) messages. Statements: Monthly/yearly/on-demand holding and transaction statements are sent to the counter-parties via SWIFT network. Swift MT535 and MT536 (messages for Statement of transactions) that support ClearStream and FundSettle formats are generated. Settlements: Transfer agency Settlement instructions are transformed into MT540/541, MT542 /MT543 (messages for settlement instructions) messages and are loaded into State street accounting system. Global Reconciliation Platform: Provides solutions to carry out the reconciliation and life cycle management of all trades that are placed within the funds where State Street is the Transfer agent for and where settlement is expected in the various platforms available for example Clearstream and Euroclear.

FDNY chose Oracle Engineered Systems - 2 Exadata Systems & 2 Exalogic Systems - as the replacements and I was brought in during the planning phase of the Exalogic implementation to help with the design and deployment of the overall hardware and software infrastructure.

Given that GPIL was a major ""Oracle shop"" and owned several Oracle hardware & software products, they chose to continue that association and use Oracle Engineered Systems for the migration. The entire effort was a series of large and small projects undertaken to eventually bring all of GPIL\'s systems on Exadata/Exalogic.

We started by designing the the end-state architecture for the enterprise and then worked backwords to plan the migration effort. During this migration, several hundred terabytes worth of databases were migrated to Exadata, over 50 COTS (including EBS, PeopleSoft & SAP) & custom applications were migrated to Exalogic, an enterprise-wide Identity Management & Single Sign-on initiative that included integration with AD & Exchange was completed and several new custom applications were developed.

Employees with authorized access to different systems had to keep track of a number of different User IDs and Passwords (for example, one for E-Business Suite for viewing their pay slips, one for iPlanet for their email, a separate one for Active Directory to login to the domain, etc.). The customer wanted a single centralized solution that would ensure that all employees would have a single user id and password that they would use to login to all different applications within the School System. The solution of choice was Oracle Identity Manager for the provisioning and OID/SSO for the single master source of truth and single sign-on. I was the solution architect and heading the technical team tasked with integrating all the different applications and bringing them all under the Single Sign-On umbrella. I designed a solution where all new employees that are hired into the organization's HRMS system (Oracle E-Business Suite), will automatically get an account provisioned into the Oracle Internet Directory, E-Business Suite, iPlanet, Active Directory and MacSchool by employing Oracle Identity Manager as the central provisioning system. Any changes to a user's account would be managed centrally via the Oracle Identity Manager and would then automatically get propagated to all other systems. Users wishing to view their payslips or login to Discoverer would be able to do so via a single login page, i.e., the Single Sign-On.\n\nOracle Identity Management Implementation\nTechnology Used: Oracle E-Business Suite R12, Oracle Database 11g, Oracle Identity Manager, Oracle Access Manager, Oracle Internet Directory, Microsoft Windows Active Directory, MacSchool Student Information System\nDetails: This was an upgrade of the previous environment that the customer undertook after running Single Sign-on with Oracle E-Business Suite 11i successfully for almost 4 years. The customer was in the process of upgrading their Oracle Applications environment to R12 and wanted to perform a simultaneous upgrade of their Identity Management environment to the latest 11g version. Both of these activities were undertaken in order to stay under Oracle's current support umbrella as well as to implement additional validations and business processs. Because of the fact that Oracle IdM 11g is a completely different product from the old 10g version, rather than it being an upgrade, this project was a full-blown implementation of a complete identity management system designed to automate all of the customer's needs with respect to user account management and administration."", u'Solutions Architect & Project Lead\nADS Inc - Virginia Beach, VA\nAtlantic Diving Supply is a prime-vendor of supplies to the US military and US government. The customer required a CRM system to be built so that ADS can offer a workflow management as a service to its customers and also a full-fledged ERP system to help streamline the company\'s business processes. The CRM system was required to be highly scalable and customizable to support the extremely different workflow needs of each of ADS\' customers. I led the project with a team of 7 developers working in development of a custom application and worked with another team of 10 consultants involved in configuring and deploying Oracle\'s eBusiness Suite of Applications for ADS. Currently, the entire set of applications is in Maintenance.\n\nProject Details\nSpecial Operations Logistics & Visibility Solution (SOLVS)\nTechnology Used: Oracle Application Express, Oracle Database 10g, Oracle eBusiness Suite 11i\nDetails: This is a highly scalable and available CRM system. It allows ADS to provide its customers with a workflow management service for material ordering. It is designed to allow ADS\' customers to order material from ADS via a secure & exclusive (to each customer) website and incorporates a sophisticated workflow that allows each customer to customize the application according to its own very specific and unique requirements. Tight integration with Oracle eBusiness Suite allows real-time acceptance of orders by ADS Sales staff and processing, thereby reducing lead time for order fulfillment to a bare minimum. Also provides transparency for the customer by giving up-to-date info on the status of each order.\n\nQuote Management System (QMS)\nTechnology Used: Oracle Application Express, Oracle Database 10g, Oracle eBusiness Suite 11i\nDetails: ADS has very special requirements with regards to the way they submit quotes to their customers. A variety of rules and special constraints were required to be in place before ADS sales staff could be allowed to generate quotes. In addition, special workflows including quote value limits, pricing thresholds, etc. were also required. All these reasons prompted the development of a custom Quote Management System that incorporated all these features along with tight integration with Oracle eBusiness Suite. QMS has been integrated right into the heart of the Oracle eBusiness Suite CRM & OM modules and allows Sales staff to convert leads into opportunities (handled by CRM) into quote (handled by QMS) and then finally book a quote into a Sales Order.\n\nOracle eBusiness Suite Implementation\nTechnology Used: Oracle eBusiness Suite 11i\nDetails: Oracle\'s eBusiness Suite is an industry leading ERP solution that looks at automating all the business processes of a company including HR, Supply Chain Management, Sales Management, Online Sales, Inventory Management, Warehouse Management, Customer Management, Financial Management, etc. GL, AR, AP, CE, INV, WSH, WMS, OM, PO, IBE (iStore), IBC, JTF, CRM modules have been implemented. In addition, custom applications - SOLVS & QMS have been integrated with Apps to provide functionality not available in Apps.\n\nCustom Reporting\nTechnology Used: Oracle Discoverer 10g, Oracle Database 10g, Oracle eBusiness Suite 11i\nDetails: ADS had a lot of custom reporting and Business Intelligence Requirements that we fulfilled by implementing Oracle Discoverer 10g. We used the pre-seeded Oracle Apps EUL and added our own customizations to implement the reports and executive dashboards that were required.\n\nSales Order EDI Interface\nTechnology Used: Oracle Application Express, Oracle Database 10g, Oracle eBusiness Suite 11i\nDetails: ADS receives orders from its customers in a variety of ways including phoned in orders, via the ADS website, etc. One of the most important modes of order receipt is EDI data files. Different customers use different formats for the datafiles. The Sales Order EDI Interface is capable of handling all the different and varied formats by allowing the EDI Administrator to train the system in identifying the data received by defining ""EDI Sets"".']",[u'Bachelors in Computer Sciences'],"[u'Delhi University Delhi, Delhi']",degree_1 : Bachelors in Compter Sciences
