Reduced Function budget costs by ~$280K\n\u2022 Improved from reporting monthly to reporting hourly using automation gained by learning Qlikview. Managed teams reporting through 4 versions of Service Manager and 7 versions of Microsoft Office\n\u2022 Automated all reporting which eliminated human interaction. Team focus on monitoring and development instead of manual processes\n\nDetailed Accomplishments:\nExcellence in Operational Management (EOM)\n\u2022 My Function was selected to be the pilot for the Department. EOM principles are geared to improve performance and best practices for managing work and people.\n\u2022 I was brought into this effort due to my knowledge of data and metrics. I took the concept of EOM and applied State Farm data to create tools and reports to measure our performance in a clear method.\n\u2022 Information gained showed areas that needed improvements where to focus their attention to correct inefficient processes\n\u2022 For example the tools I created helped our Network team improve their completion before deadline from 60% to 83% of the time on 225,000 records annually.\n\nContract Verification Tool (CVT)\n\u2022 Scope of this project, two vendors with over 30,000 contracts that need to be managed across the enterprise.\n\u2022 I was asked to create a relational database to keep track of vendor contracts for the contract management team.\n\u2022 Prior to tool being built there was an issue with duplicate charges, equipment off warranty, retired equipment and new equipment not in service being charged. Much of this due to over 30 different locations and involvement of many people using different methods to account for contracts.\n\u2022 I built a unified approach that created an organized workflow saving State Farm $3 million in over charges. Tool had built in automation and security and is now managed primarily by 2 people allowing the other 25-30 people to perform other duties.\n\nMetrics, Scorecard/Dashboards using Qlikview\n\u2022 There was a need to mature metrics for the incident management process to serve at the Enterprise level across State Farm. State Farm has one of the largest networks in the country, with more than 4 million incidents annually, impacting their environment. We created a suite of tools using Qlikview that would be used at different levels in the organization to track Service Level Objectives (SLO) using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). This tool suite measures the effectiveness and efficiency in recovering from outages and impacts. In 2015 my team received approval to do this at an enterprise level. I was the Team Lead and Lead Developer partnering with our Business Planning team.\n\u2022 I led the team to create 14 tools that targeted different levels of management and organizational groupings. Each tool followed the same familiar design to make it easy for users to operate. These tools help users understand current workload and they are updated hourly, along with historical trending of completed and projected work. All of these tools were developed using Agile philosophy.\n\u2022 Benefits to customers and State Farm:\n\u25e6 Going from monthly reporting to hourly, Data is now actionable and fresh\n\u25e6 Standardized Key Performance Indicators across the Enterprise\n\u25e6 Educated and communicated better business practices\n\u25e6 With more than 5,000 workgroups supporting technologies across the company, many functions had their own reporting teams collecting data. The added functionality targeted the needs in such a way that the majority of these other teams were no longer needed allowing these analysts to focus on other work to improve their services using our tools.', u'Daily Operation Coordinator Workforce Management\nState Farm - Bloomington, IL\nDecember 1997 to October 2000\nRemote Worker in New York)\nDepartment: Systems, Function: Business Services\n\nSummary of job duties:\nServed on a team with two other analysts monitoring, reporting and developing tools to support a 200-analyst call center handling front-line helpdesk calls. Lucent CentreVu Supervisor Call Management System which collected the data on 30 teams supervised by 15 Managers. Served as an administrator that monitors real-time activities and scheduled and moved analysts to ensure proper daily coverage and staffing.\n\nDetailed Accomplishments:\nCall center averaged 35,000 plus calls a month, and there were efforts ongoing to try and eliminate/mitigate as many of these calls as possible. To help in managing this workload until automation and reorganization, I created three key tools in MS Excel and MS Access.\n\u2022 Erlang calculator in Excel to show the law of diminishing return occurred for staff. Enabled management to see where the cutoff was answering 80% of the calls in 60 seconds and being under or over staffed.\n\u2022 Staffing Program to project workload and staffing needs based on trends related to Average Handle Time (AHT) and incoming phone calls (ACD). This tool determined when we needed people scheduled to maintain the Service Level.\n\u2022 Function database to contain organizational structure along the work hours for the associates in our function. I created the database in MS Access for use by the secretaries, management and the WFM team to store work schedules, teams, staff transitions and communication of these changes to our function. It also included distribution lists, organizational reports and was connected to the staffing tool to supply scheduled hours.']","[u'', u'']","[u'University Missouri St. Louis UMSL St. Louis, MO', u'Illinois State University ISU, Heartland Community College']","degree_1 : , degree_2 :  "
