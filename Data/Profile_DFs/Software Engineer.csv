My team was responsible for providing and monitoring the Launch Portal, a front-end UI for customers to use CDK Drive. My team also provides framework and utility services for CDK Drive application to ease application development and deployment.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\u27a2 UI Developer\n* Led the development effort to rewrite an ActiveX navigation tree utilizing an open source library called FancyTree and JavaScript. The new tree was up to current web-standards and was able to run for all major browsers while maintaining the same look and feel for end-users. The product went out to over 350,000 users and was a major success. Fancytree is a jQuery plug in that provides support for various functions like Drag and Drop, lazy loading, inline editing and more, all of which I needed to implement for this project. The nodes of the tree were functions within the product which could be launched, sorted, and favorited in ways based on customer preference.\n* Enhanced Drive's performance monitoring capabilities. CDK Drive has a feature called PC Health Report that gave support engineers information about the health and compatibility of client computers. I made several alterations to the PC Health report via JavaScript, such as adding new fields and getting new data to display.\n\n\u27a2 PHP5 Works\n* Spearheaded the efforts to retool and rewrite CDK Drive's Quick Launch feature. CDK could launch various functions quickly using both the Navigation Tree and the Quick Launch Bar. I rewrote the PHP to be compliant with current standards and best practices, while also making the Quick Launch compatible with the company's constantly evolving software.\n\n\u27a2 HTML5/CSS Enablement\n* Subject Matter Expert for HTML5/CSS on my team, and I played a key role in helping teams across the company to adopt and update their HTML5 files with non-deprecated code and more elegant styling. I assisted developers from more than four other teams in tracking down deprecated code, and helped to bring them up to speed with current HTML best practices. I rewrote over 20 webpages and brought them up to HTML5 standards. I also assisted in a transition to external CSS styling, by removing inline style tags, creating various stylesheets and referencing them.\n\n\u27a2 Performance Monitoring and Bash Scripting\n* Created a method of getting the startup metrics for CDK Drive on Client Systems, as well as more complex metrics regarding the performance of Drive. I did this by creating a script that would gather data upon initiating the client. These features were later incorporated into the PC Health Report.\n* Also worked on automation of software updating by creating a script that could update release information when a new release was rolled out. This script searched out old release version information and replaced it with the up to date data.\n\n\u27a2 General Support and Bug Fixing\n* In addition to specific products I worked on, one of my main responsibilities was going through old code and making fixes to urgent bugs that have recently emerged.""]",[u'Bachelors of Science in Computer Science'],[u'Oberlin College\nMay 2016']

While I have had the opportunity to create and contribute to many different systems, I am the program manager and principal developer & architect for the following applications:\n1) A document creation and assembly library that has been implemented both as an integrated Microsoft Word Add-In as well as a cloud-based service. The library produces reliable and properly formatted court documents for attorneys and their staff, massively improving attorney & staff efficiency. The product was recently expanded to include client documents, and produces platform-independent documents for use on any device. This was implemented as a Microsoft WCF REST-based service layer to assemble fragments of disparate technologies using Microsoft's Azure Tables for storage.\n2) A firm-wide business data API/service layer shared among all applications which provides consistent data to all in-house developed applications, which improves consistent among all applications and improves application performance. In the most extreme case, we were able to reduce the execution time to 0.8% of previous measurements in some processes. This service layer was originally SOAP but has been upgraded to REST, using Microsoft Web API as the base technology. Additionally, we have begun the process of migrating the larger functional units to Docker containers, and microservice architecture.\n3) Creation of many (10+) ASP.NET intranet applications for Holland & Hart's staff, in the interest of automating daily processes and also interfacing with several vendors including Verizon.
