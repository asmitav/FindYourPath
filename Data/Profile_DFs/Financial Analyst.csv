This paper is the first attempt to analyze competitive and welfare effects of cross-holdings allowing for product differentiation.\nI analyze these effects for both substitutable and complementary products under quantity and price competition, respectively. I find that both the strength of the competitive implications\n\n1 of 2\nand the conditions resulting in these implications critically depend on the degree of product\ndifferentiation. My analysis has useful empirical and policy applications.\n\u2022 The Impact of High-Speed Rail on Air Transport in China\nHigh-Speed Rail service (HSR) in China was introduced on April 18, 2007 and has become\nimmensely popular with an annual ridership of over 1.44 billion in 2016. The HSR network\nlinks the most important metropolitan areas which are also the most important aviation\ndestinations. I investigate the competition between high-speed rail and air transport in China using Hotelling's location model. I also test whether HSR has significantly changed the frequency and market share of airlines using regression with data at the route level. My\nresults show that on average, HSR has reduced the number of air transport operations by\n24 percent in the route with distance less than 800 km. After the entry of HSR, the air\ntransport share of the total market is 0.23 points lower.\n\u2022 Assimilation and Economic Outcomes in the Age of Migration: Evidence from Chinese 1.5\nGeneration Immigrants\nI examine Chinese 1.5 generation immigrants assimilation with respect to language skill\nemployed in the US labor market across cohorts of childhood immigrants using 2000 IPUMS\ndata. I use an instrumental variable for English proficiency that is immigrants' age at arrival to analyze the relationship between English proficiency and social assimilation. I find that\nEnglish proficiency raises the probabilities of being divorced, marrying a US native, having\na more educated and higher earning spouse, and having fewer children.\n\u2022 Modified Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and Applications\nThe traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) is a commonly accepted as a measurement of concentration level in a market. Traditional studies use the change of the HHI to predict\nthe change of social welfare: changes in the market that cause HHI to rise are thought to be\nsocially undesirable. However, with cross-holdings HHI might be misleading. The Modified\nHHI is proved to be a better measurement of market concentration and is an accepted tool in regulators' assessment of competitive risks imposed by cross-holdings. I demonstrate that\nthe Modified HHI might also be misleading. I provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when welfare and the Modified HHI to move in opposite directions as one singe firm raises\nownership share in its rivals.\n\u2022 Competitiveness of Cross-Holdings in Repeated Cournot Oligopolies (joint with Cheng-Zhong\nQin, and Jianxia Yang)\nWhen a firm acquires passive ownership in a rival firm, the acquiring firm competes less\naggressively in static oligopoly models. We show that for a model of repeated Cournot\noligopoly with product differentiation, there is a class of cross-holdings based on empirical\nobservations that weaken punishments for defecting relative to incentives to defect from collusive agreements. Contrasting to the anticompetitive implications in one-shot Cournot\ncompetition, cross-holdings with only one acquiring firm hinder collusion in repeated Cournot\ncompetition. An implication of this result is that antitrust concerns should not be raised with such cross-holdings. We also discuss sensitivities of the competitiveness of cross-holdings to\nproduct differentiation."", u'Instructor\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara - Santa Barbara, CA\nAugust 2008 to May 2010\nLed two hour-long recitation sessions per week; Clarified key concepts that were covered in lectures, provided further examples and practice problems, and introduced some additional\nnew material that was not elsewhere presented.
